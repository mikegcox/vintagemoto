### My brother Pat came from BC and we assembled the bike.

Piston is still on backorder but arrived today (March 24th) so I can now put together the top-end.  I bought some shoulder washers from Honda for hoding on the rear fender.  I was reluctant to pay the $5.00 per washer price but in the end it was so worth it.  Dealer sold me a Wiseco piston ring but it is not going to work with a NOS piston so I have ordered one from eBay
