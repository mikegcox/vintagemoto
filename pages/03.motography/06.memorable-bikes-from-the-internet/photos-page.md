These photos were found online.  Many of the bikes shown here were owned by someone in my family and seeing them brings back such fond memories and some not-so-fond memories - like the "Breako".

Seen here:  1981 Honda CR-125:  Jim owned one in 1982, he loved it and rode it fast, sold it to his brother-in-law in Cornwall.  1982 Honda CR-480: Pat bought one new in 1983, we had a lot of good racing that year. There are some mid-80s CRs in there as well, I rode Honda 125s then and Bernie had a CR-250.  Pat owned a CR-500 later on, there is one shown below.  There is also a picture of a 1982 490 Maico.  Bernie had one, it was an expensive exotic European bike that broke more than it ran.  He bought and loved a 1983 CR-250 the following year and went faster than ever without breaking down.
