In 1988 I bought a bike from Allan Mycasiw for dirt cheap. It was an offer I could not refuse.  I didn't ride it much but I did manage to enter a couple races in those years.  This bike was originally owned by Shane Drew who is still active in the professional motocross scene as far as I know.  The bike was a 1986 CR-250 and I was able to ride it pretty fast.  On practice days I was able to dice with Chris Shipclark who was the local champ in those days.  The picture of the unknown rider may be Chris but I don't remember much.
