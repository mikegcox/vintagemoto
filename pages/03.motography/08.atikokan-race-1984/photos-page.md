In the early 1980s Bernie Cox managed to organize some epic races at Charleston.  The races were sponsored by the Atikokan Sports Days committee so the prize money was better than normal.  The money along with just being an awesome place to race attracted racers from other districts such as Manitoba and we had some excellent Canadian racers attend including Kim Hoode, Shane Drew, Glen Nicholson.  I was was the local favourite and I was riding as fast as anybody there but I had bike problems.
