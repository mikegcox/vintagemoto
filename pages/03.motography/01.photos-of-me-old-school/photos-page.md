### Photos taken in 1984 by Mark Hancock a.k.a. Marcock (Shown working on a Moto-Ski)

These pictures were taken at a gravel pit behind Marion Lake.  There was a big pile of crushed stone and at the top there was ledge where I could launch myslef and I would fly back down the hill.  Pictures were taken with a Kodak Disc camera.  Remember those? Good for capturing action shots but the film was so small the resulting pictures were pretty low resolution.
