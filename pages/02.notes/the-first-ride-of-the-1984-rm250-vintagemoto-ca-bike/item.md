## Well, here is something a little different... perhaps a little nerdy.

I bought a Mac a while ago and started using iMovie.  I am getting the hang of using it.  I put this video together to document the occasion.  The song I used is by Charles de Lint from his Old Blue Truck record.  Thanks for the great tune Charles.  

Rob Kern was there when I bougt the bike.  He gave me a ride to Low Quebec to pick it up so it was only fitting that he was here to help me put the wheels on and fire it up.  I sure have nice neighbours and I look forward to enjoying a few rides with him this summer.
