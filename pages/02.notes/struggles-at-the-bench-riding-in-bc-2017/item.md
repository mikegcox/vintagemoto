title: 'Struggles at the Bench - Riding in BC, 2017'
---

I don't own a GoPro camera yet, there are usually enough of them mounted on the helmets of my riding mates to make hundreds of hours of video footage- and really, how much could one more camera add?  For the spring BC ride of 2017, there were usually three cameras recording the adventures.  In reviewing the footage, it is always fun to come across the struggles, those places where the really sketchy shit happens.  There is no shortage of curses, grunts and groans. I though it would be fun to make a "FUCK!" video where you can hear the rider cursing for all he is worth.  This idea was spawned mostly by watching the footage from Mackenzie Cox's GoPro, he can get pretty emotional when things don't go his way on the trails.

In 2017, I brought a friend with me to enjoy the adventure.  Korrey bought himself some new gear for the trip including the latest greatest GoPro camera.  It is voice activated and it really picks up the sound well.  On this particular day we went to "The Bench" and we were met with all sorts of struggles.  A late Spring meant that the trails had not been opened yet and there was still snow.  This video comes from Korrey's camera and while I don't mean to pick on him, he was fairly vocal at the start of the ride.  Once we got further along, he became accustomed to the terrain and there was less spontaneous commentary.  This video is just the first part of the ride and brings to light a bit of misinformation that Pat conveyed upon reaching the start of the trails.
