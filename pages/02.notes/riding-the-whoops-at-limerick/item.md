## A selfie VintageMoto style...

### I have not posted in a while.  I have been busy working at the marina, working for my own website customers, playing music and riding dirt bikes.

I have some epic stories that I want to write.  Next on the list is a chronicle of my great adventure to BC with Bernie to ride the hills with Jordie, Pat and Mike.  I also have many vintage stories to tell, but all in good time.

Today is a quick tale that comes with a short video.  My plan with this Vintage Moto experience was to get a bike that I would ride occasionally and attend a race or two each year. I can see now that I can easily get carried away with this hobbie.  I have ridden the bike six times now - actual rides where I burn a tank of gas.  I love the bike and every time I ride it, I just want to ride it more.  I will elaborate more on my adventures in another post, this one is just to show the little video I made.

###  This is in Limerick Forest.  There are many areas in the pine trees where natural whoops form.  I really like this little stretch so I stopped and propped my phone up in the sand and did a drive-bye.

### Limerick Forest is a lot of fun.  Every time I go I find something new but it is getting quite familiar now. 

With that familiarity comes a little more speed and I am moving pretty fast through the woods.  The first time I rode here was 2004 and I was pretty serious about motocross.  Riding in the woods was not what I wanted to do and I got hurt pretty bad.  That is another story though and I even have photos to go along with it.  I have quite a bit of woods experience now having riddin with the Brothers Cox in Arizona, Northern Ontario and BC and I am really enjoying it.  It is a nice change of pace for this Vintage Motocross Racer.

### Here is my track for the day.  I covered 30KM in an hour and a half riding.  I didn't get tired at all, woods riding is good for old guys. 

I absolutely love this bike.  I think it does everything well.  It turns great, handling is superb and the suspension is awesome.  The brakes work fine too, I don't care what others say. I let my friends Korrey and Mark both ride it and the both hated the brakes.  But hey, brakes just slow you down.
