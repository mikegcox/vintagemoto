Four years in a row I have had the great fortune of heading to BC to ride dirt bikes with family and friends.  This video taken from Mackenzie's GoPro was taken from our ride day at "The Flats".  To get to the flats, we gear up at Pat's house and ride right from the house.  It is great fun and offers all the great riding I have come to expect from BC riding.
