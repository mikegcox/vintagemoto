title: 'Chattaway Hill Climb'

In April 2017, we had another family ride week.  I arrived on Tuesday and stayed for a week.  Mac and Arren arrived on the previous Friday so they had a few rides in before I arrived.  One ride was at Chattawa where Pat and Mike have a motocross track and there are some pretty good sandy hill-climb opportunities.
