Last fall I went for one last ride for the the 2016 season.  I went to Limerick forest and had a very unfortunate incident when I decided not to tie my bike down to the trailer properly. I did manage to salvage that day and get out for a good ride but it was that ride that [got me to thinking about a new steed](http://vintagemoto.ca/notes/have-you-ever-done-anything-this-dumb). 

> I have to confess though. I love the old RM-250, it is really cool to ride a bike from my youth, but I am getting the itch to upgrade. Don't tell Mrs. Vintage Moto though. It handles great, the suspension works just fine, the power is awesome and it is so simple compared to modern machinery. But the breaks are shit! Every time I put on the rear brake, it would stay on for a second longer than necessary. More adapting. I will have to do some maintenance before I ride again. The other thing I have a love-hate relationship with is the seat. It is soft and comfortable, but the slope of it leaves much to be desired. I keep getting pushed to the front of the bike.

So I found myslef a 2013 RM-Z250 for $3500-  [there is no way to be half way into this sport](http://vintagemoto.ca/notes/it-is-not-possible-to-be-half-way-into-this-sport). I did some service over the winter so it was ready to go come Spring.  I kept my bikes at the marina where I work part-time and one lovely day last week I pulled them out of the barn and fired them up.

### The Vintagemoto.ca custom graphics kit on the new bike turned out great.  I love the retro look on this totally modern piece of machinery.

Yesterday I pulled my trailer out of the woods and over top of the remaining snow bank in my yard.  I blew up the tires and checked the wheel bearings and drove down to the Marina and picked up the new bike.  Today the weather was perfect for a ride so I decided to go to Campbell Road near Calabogie.  I have ridded there several times now and I like it even though you can cover all the terrain fairly quickly.  Here in Dunrobin, the snow is almost completely gone but the closer I got to Calabogie, the more snow there was.  I parked the car and walked through the snow to discover the forest was snow-free for the most part.

I put on the gear and went for a ride and I have to say, this new bike feels like cheating compared to the vintage iron I rode last year.  There is just something about having proper brakes, a flat saddle and modern suspension that makes a bike easy to ride.  This is the first time owning a four-stroke motocross bike.  I have many hours of seat time on borrowed four-strokes, but this one is mine.  I didn't ride for long, I was not feeling well.  I ran out of my asthma inhalant and my guts were feeling knotted up. I also kept running into snow and then I would lose the track.  I ended up making some of my own tracks and I had a lot of fun throwing snow-roost.  

Today was a good day.  I love my new bike! I don't have a single complaint other than missing the smell of premix exhaust. Suzuki makes one hell of a nice chassis and the power was way better than I thought it would be.  When you read the magazines, they mention the zooks are under powered but I have always found I go the same speed no matter what bike I am saddled on. If I had more power, I am not sure I would know what to do with it. I was tearing through the woods at a pretty good pace today and if I was going faster on this bike, it is only because it is easier to ride.

### No pictures or videos today, no GPS track either- I forgot my phone at home today.  Best I can do is show that there is a bit of dirt on my beautiful new bike.

Tomorrow I ride again.  My wife's cousin Bill Fretts has invited me up to his cottage for a bit of trail riding.  I am not sure what to expect, new terrain, snow in the bush, high-water, new riding mate, new bike.  That last part is not a problem for sure, I put that worry behind me today.
