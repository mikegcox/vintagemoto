### This is a very good story from mxworksbike.com

mxworksbike.com is an awesome website that I discovered today. They are the home of the largest collection of works bikes and bikes of historical importance.  I particularly liked this story as Kent Howerton is telling the story of his championship 1980 season aboard a Suzuki 250.  He switched to the Full Floater in mid season - the Full Floater won its first AMA race in the legendary hands of Kent Howerton.
