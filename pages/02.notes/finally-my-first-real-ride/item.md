Yesterday I wrote a story about [finally getting the engine running properly](http://vintagemoto.ca/notes/some-adjustment-are-in-order) and the suspension working a bit better. I was also pining about not having a place close by to go for a ride.  When I woke this morning and did some further editing on that story, it drove me over the edge.  Maybe I should have gone into work. The marina is very busy on the May long-weekend and I am sure they would appreciate my help but I worked Sunday, so I decided to claim holiday Monday as my own.

The decision was made, it was time to go for a real ride... but where?  I know the suspension is too soft for Motocross, especially Sand-del-lee.  It is a track that is now part of the Canadian Nationals circuit so the jumps are big and the ramps are steep and I think I would have a lot more fun doing single-track.  I have to admit though, it would be fun to show the bike off a bit, but that will come soon enough.  A couple of years ago a neighbour gave me directions to some trails near Calabogie and I took Rose with me to ride for the day.  We mostly did dirt-road riding but I did spy some nice single-track that day so I decided that was the place for today.

I got my gear from the basement and did an inventory to make sure I had enough protection.  I loaded up the bike on my horrible and not road-legal trailer and filled the gas-tank.  I filled the camel-back with some water and was ready to go.  I spent a few minutes with Mrs. Vintage Moto to let her know where I would be riding and when she should expect to hear from me.  I am not sure if there is cell service out there, so leaving some sort of a flight-plan is only good sense.

### This is where I parked for the ride.  It took about an hour to get there.

I was hoping I might run into other riders and maybe join up for little while and get to know the area.  There was not a soul to be found so this was definitely a solo ride.

### I need to get an action cam, but until that day arrives, I will just use my phone and iMovie.

I have to tell a little story about my gear.  I bought a matching pants and jersey about 15 years ago from Johnny Grant.  He switched from Suzuki to Yamaha so he needed Yamaha coloured gear.  I had a Honda at the time and really didn't care if my gear matched my bike so long as it fit me.  The price was right and I bought Johnny's Suzuki coloured gear.  I later bought a Yamaha and kept the gear.  Last summer at Sand-del-lee Johnny commented that I was still wearing that same old gear I bought from him.  It is still in good shape so why not?  I now have a Suzuki to match the gear although the Suzuki is about 15 years older than the gear.  

Along with the pants and jersey, I have boots that my brother Pat gave to me.  I have pink Scott goggles that I bought for the kids,  I have knee pads that I bought in B.C. the [year I got hurt](http://vintagemoto.ca/notes/the-epic-multi-generational-bc-dirt-bike-adventure-of-2015) and I have a kidney belt that no longer fits... or does it?  You see since reaching an all-time high weight in excess of 240 pounds at Christmas, I am now down to 221 pounds.  I thought I was going to need to visit Johnny again and buy more of his old gear but it all fits again. It fits good- just like it did when I bought it 15 years ago. I am a big guy, I could carry 240 alright, but I feel a lot better losing that 20 pounds.

### I finally have gear that matches my bike and it fits again too.

Alright, enough rambling... how did the ride go?  Well, the ride went really well!  I packed a few tools in my camel-back just in case.  I noticed right away that I had too much rear brake pedal so I stopped and tightened the adjuster nut.  The old bike has drum brakes front and rear and I must say, they work just fine.  They are a lot different than the new bikes, but they do the job.  

I got into the single-track immediately.  It is a sandy pine-tree forest and the ground is covered with pine needles.  The tracks are easy to follow and it is tight, a lot of turns. Mostly first-gear stuff and when there is a straight stretch, it doesn't last long.  I wound my way through the trees, along some swamps, up and down some small hills.  I was taking it slow getting to know the bike and area.  I came to a bigger hill that was covered in big boulders and I lugged right up it.  This engine will lug surprisingly well.  At the top of the hill is a turn and then down the other side.  I applied the brakes and to my great surprise, the rear brakes were gone.

I pulled over and had a look, the brake cable snapped right at the adjuster.  I pulled out some tools and removed broken parts and put them in my bag.  I was feeling congested.  I get asthma in the spring and I didn't bring an inhaler.  So now I am fifteen minutes into my ride, I have no back-brakes, I am alone and I am asthmatic.  I figured this might be the end of the ride, I might just go home, but again, you just never know.

### Another fuzzy Blackberry Passport shot showing the missing brake cable.  

I kept on riding and after a while I my lungs were fine and I got used to riding without the rear brake.  It is a good thing I was riding alone, I could go at a safe pace without being tempted to do something I should not.  All the trails seemed to end right where I parked and time after time I got back to the car and just turned around again and did a few more circuits.  There was much more to see, but I was having a blast in the tight trails.  I will explore next time.

## Bike Impressions

#### For this kind of riding, the bike worked really well.  

- The suspension is very soft which is great in the woods although it will be tough on the motocross track.  
- The motor could not be better.  It ran really good at low-speed, I could lug it when I needed to and the power was always there no matter how tight the trails or open the roads.  When coming into the power band there is a huge hit, it really rips and seems to have great power everywhere.  Does it compare favourably to the 2016 KTM 300XC I drove a month ago?  Yes, it holds it own!
- Perhaps for single-track riding I should put a larger rear sprocket just to slow it down a bit and help on the big hills.
- I like the big wide soft seat.  I was sitting most of the time and my butt is not sore.  10-minutes on the 300XC and I was sore for a week.
- Brakes worked fine.  I would have no problem locking up the front brakes if I had to and the rear brakes were great until the cable let go.  Of course I would rather have disk brakes, but these are fine.
- Handling was superb.  At first I felt the front end to be a bit hard to manage, but within 15 minutes of riding, I never had that feeling again.  The bike is very light especially the front end and it turned on a dime in that very tight sandy terrain.
- It is loud.  If I am going to race it, I doubt it will pass sound-check.

### This is what it looks like when riding here.  I loved the trails.


## Riding Area Impressions

I loved the area.  I stayed quite close to the car but it was hard to tell because the trails were winding every direction.  The area I rode felt a lot bigger than it actually was.  At first I was worried I would get too far away and have a hard time finding my way back but that was not the case at all.  There are a lot more places to explore so I am definitely coming back.

### I turned on my tracker.  I rode 25 KM.  Total running time was 1hr-25min. I hardly ever got out of first gear.  I did quite a few loops.
