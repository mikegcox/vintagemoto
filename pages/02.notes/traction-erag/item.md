## What is the Traction eRag?

### Irreverent, authentic, the dirtbike magazine you’ve always wanted. Either you get it, or you don’t.

What’s an eRag? It’s electronic and it’s a rag, you know, a shitty magazine. Inside you’ll find strange characters, ridiculous rides, brutally honest reviews and questionable content. It’s about riding, not race results. [Get it here](http://tractionerag.ca), FREE.

### Don't watch Game of Thrones this week!  Watch this movie instead.  No babies die!  As a matter of fact, nothing bad happens at all. It is **pure inspiration** and shot in Ontario- our tax dollars were finally spent wisely.

I think they should shoot their next video in Pickle Lake before Bernie and Lynn make their exit.  Hundreds of kilometers of trails cut by an animated, entertaining, engaging, life-long dirt biker who is turning 60 in September.
