I went a little overboard with the bike graphics.  I normally would not care in the least what graphics are on the bike, but now I seem to desire some personalization.  Number 81 is my sentimental favourite number.  In 1983, that was my assigned racing number allocated by the Canadian Motorcycle Assiciation (CMA).  My brother Pat was asigned number 82 and along with Bernie and Jim, we all did some racing that year.

When I restored the old '84 I did not think twice, I put 81 as the number so it only makes sense that my new bike also sport the same number but in the opposing colour scheme of white on black.  All I really wanted was a set of numbers, but I opted to spend a few extra dollars and do the rad shrouds and swingarm too.

I brought the bike down to the marina to work on it. I have a bit of a workshop at home but it is in my basement. I would have to take the bike apart to get it down the stairs.  My trailer is buried in 16-inches of ice and snow and blocked in behind a 7-foot high snow bank so I had to drive the bike to the shop by driving 3-KM down the Ottawa River and I made it just as the rain started to fall.

I read in my owner's manual that you can find how many hours are on the 2013 RM-Z250 buy connecting a battery and a test light.  All you need to do is buy the connectors from Suzuki.  Instead I looked up on the Internet how to make your own. 

#### I found the following instructions on the [VitalMX forum](http://www.vitalmx.com/forums/Race-Shop,42/Reading-engine-hours-on-13-RMZ-250,1270680) posed by Slamdrew

Ok, I figured it out. Hopefully this will help anyone google searching for this info like I was. I would think a 2013 RMZ 450 would be the same, but this was done on my 250 to read original hours on the bike. You'll need a second person to make it easier. 

I just got a little 12v LED bulb, an old 12v motorcycle battery, and some wire. Oh, and a digital stop watch. 

Unplug your fuel coupler and wire the light bulb between the red and white with red tracer wires.
