I went a little overboard with the bike graphics.  I normally would not care in the least what graphics are on the bike, but now I seem to desire some personalization.  Number 81 is my sentimental favourite number.  In 1983, that was my assigned racing number allocated by the Canadian Motorcycle Assiciation (CMA).  My brother Pat was asigned number 82 and along with Bernie and Jim, we all did some racing that year.
