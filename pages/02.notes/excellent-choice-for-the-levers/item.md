## I am quite pleased with how this turned out.

It is difficult to find a decent front brake lever for an old bike with drum brakes. Since 1984 almost every bike made has come with front disk brakes which means there is a master cylinder instead of a cable perch. To compromise, I put a clutch lever on the brake side upside down.

### To make the brake side look more natural, I drilled out the threads on the bolt hole so that the lever bolt-head would be on top.

### Clutch lever works perfect and looks nice too. it is not too blingy and the blue blends nicely.

I bought these levers on ebay, they are called 'AOF Alloy MX Dirt Bike Motocross Spring Loaded Clutch Lever Perch Z7-Blue'. The price was only $60 all-in- delivered to the door. The levers are very generic and plain and I am sure a nicer lever would fit in the perch but the alloy perch is excellent and the quick-adjuster is perfect and works very smooth with a good solid spring-loaded click when adjusting.  

I did try to go to the dealer and buy these parts but there was nothing to look at. Everything has to be ordered in and I wanted to see it before buying. Pro Taper makes one that I thought would have been great but I wanted to see it prior to dropping $200 on the purchase. The ones on ebay looked similar and the price was such that I could swallow should I not be satisfied. I found them on Amazon too and the reviews were very positive so I took a bigger chance and ordered two.

Really cold out today, -3C. I would love to haul the bike outside, but what's the point.
