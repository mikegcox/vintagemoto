I found this 2001 Suzuki RM250 on Kijiji.  The guy was asking $1300 and the ad said it needed a clutch and a pipe.The title said "Need Gone!"  I offered $600 based on the age of the bike and the fact that just to get it running it would need a clutch, a pipe and a seat assuming everything else was fine.  The guy didn't like the offer but after a month of trying to sell, he fianlly accepted my offer.
