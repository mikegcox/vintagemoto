### Article in MXA By Tom White

This is a different sort of vintage motocross than I have gotten into. To be fair, the article refers to true vintage bikes, the kind that were being raced when I was playing with Tonka trucks in the sandbox out at Crystal Lake.  I am not a collector, I am just dabbling with an old bike that means a lot to me and my chosen weapon - the 1984 RM-250 shares a great deal with bikes produced today.
