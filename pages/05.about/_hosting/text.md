Most of the sites that I develop I also host.  The advantage of of this is that you will always have a **single point of contact** should any issue arise with your website or your website hosting.  Other hosting providers are large companies, or companies that just have too many customers to provide a personalized service.  If something goes wrong, [email](mailto:mcox@mcox.ca) me or pick up the phone and dial [613-614-9992](tel:613-614-9992) and I will personally solve the issue as quickly as possible.  **You don't have to fill out a form to talk to me**, just call!
