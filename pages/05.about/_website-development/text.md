My original business idea in 1997 was to develop websites.  Prior to 1997 I was a marine mechanic so my first customers were marinas, I understood their business needs so long before there was WordPress, before the acronym CMS, there was me writing code changing the way marinas listed their boats for sale.  As it turns out, there are people out there that can code a lot better than me and with an open source software movement in full swing, I stopped writing my own code and became proficient with other CMS platforms.

Every website I have ever made has been built using a CMS. I have a clear understanding of website maintenance, I know the importance of clean markup and media optimization.  Currently I am developing sites using Grav, DNN, and WordPress.  I feel it is best to know a few platforms well, it helps me to build faster so I can keep the costs low.
