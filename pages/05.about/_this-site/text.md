I have been building websites since 1998 and since then lot has changed.  We have gone from bulky computers and slow Internet to tiny computers with blistering fast Internet. Websites need to work well on as many screens as possible.  The most popular technique for creating a site that fits on all screens is called **Responsive Design**.

This website uses a responsive HTML theme that I purchased.  There are thousands of high-quality themes available to purchase from a variety of reliable sources. A good theme will come with wide variety of features and design options and be **thoroughly tested on as many platforms as possible**. [You can view the theme I purchased here.](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/epona-responsive-website-template-WB0464P7N)

Getting content (words, pictures, videos) into my chosen theme required a CMS - a **Content Management System**.  There are hundreds of excellent CMSs available, I chose to use a new open source CMS called [Grav](http://www.getgrav.org). Converting the theme into a Grav website takes time, but the result is a site that can be easily maintained while remaining true to the original design.  There is **no compromising the design** to fit the CMS, Grav can be used with any design.  Grav also has many pre made themes available, I could have chosen one of them and saved a lot of time, but I like to learn new things.

> Grav was built to address problems that modern web design was asking, and traditional CMS platforms were not solving. In essence, it's a simple but flexible flat-file CMS that has been designed from the ground-up to be fast and enjoyable to develop with. Unlike WordPress and other traditional CMS platforms, Grav lets you realize your design goals and your clients needs without compromise. You are not limited by your platform, Grav is a platform that adapts to your needs, not the other way around. It just sorta flips the traditional CMS paradigm on it's head. Really it just strives to make the whole process of creating sites fun again :)
